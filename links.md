## Week 00
1. [Operating System Concepts slides version](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/slide-dir/index.html)<br>
This PowerPoint version from the os Silberschatz's book helped me prepare for the weekly quiz. Since this version is smaller, it can save us sometimes and also easy to understand.
2. [Last year os students repository](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/osp-127.html)<br>
This page is actually helpful not only on the first week, but also might help us every week. it can give us some clues on what should we focus on during that particular week.
3. [Linux in 100 Seconds youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrB13utjYV4)
In this video, the instructor explains Linux in a short time. The instructor explains a brief history of Linux, explains kernel, and some useful terminal commands.

## Week 01
1. [EVERYONE Needs to Learn a Little Bit of AWK! youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ02kEETw70)<br>
I think this video is really great for beginners if they're trying to learn awk. The instructor in the video gave so many example of awk commands and he explains really well on every example.
